# cub3d

Cub3D is a simple raycasting 3D engine inspired by Wolfenstein 3D and Doom.  
It was built for the 42/School project requirements using minilibX.  
The player can explore a 2.5D maze, open doors, and navigate with WASD-style movement.

## Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/cub3d.git
cd cub3d
```

### On RPM-based distros

Install dependencies:
```bash
sudo dnf install libX11-devel libXext-devel libXrender-devel libbsd-devel
```
for debian based use apt and do your own research on missing packages

## Configuration

In minilibx_linux/Makefile.mk:4, change the compiler to match school requirements:
```make
CC = clang
```

Your own files should also be compiled using clang.

## Running the Game

```bash
make
./cub3D maps/example.cub
```

Use arrow keys / WASD to move around, and ESC to quit.
