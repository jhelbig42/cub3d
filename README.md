# cub3d

Cub3D is a simple raycasting 3D engine inspired by Wolfenstein 3D and Doom.  
It was built for the 42/School project requirements using minilibX.  
The player can explore a 2.5D maze, open doors, and navigate with WASD-style movement.

## üñ•Ô∏è Installation

Clone the repository:  
### To run on wayland based distros:
`sudo dnf install libX11-devel libXext-devel libXrender-devel libbsd-devel`
